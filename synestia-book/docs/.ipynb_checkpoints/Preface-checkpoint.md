<b>Jupyter Book Navigation</b><p>
In addition to clicking on the hyperlinks in the menus, you can page through this book using the arrow keys on your keyboard
and forward and back web page gestures on a trackpad.<p>

This book can be read like a traditional static textbook, but it also contains interactive widgets that are launched on a
cloud-based computer, so you can access these features on many
different platforms through a web interface. The purpose of these
interactive features are to help the reader learn and explore the concepts
being presented.<p>

The CoLab option for the interactives launches more quickly than Binder.<p>
